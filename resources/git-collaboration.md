# Collaborating on a project on GitHub

These are some recommendations that I would make for how to set out collaborating on a project in GitHub:
1.  Have one canonical version of your code (on one of the team members' accounts).
1.  Add all team members as [collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) on the repository.
1.  All team members clone the repository from that one place.
1.  Pulling and pushing code should all be done to that repository.
1.  If dividing the project to work on different parts of the code at the same time, try to work in different modules (or components) to avoid git conflicts.
1.  If/when git conflicts arise DON'T PANIC. It's normal.
