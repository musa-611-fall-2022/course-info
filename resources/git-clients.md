# Git Clients

Git is a source code management (SCM) tool -- the most popular one right now.

> Source code management (SCM) is used to track modifications to a source code repository. SCM tracks a running history of changes to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors. SCM is also synonymous with Version control.
>
> As software projects grow in lines of code and contributor head count, the costs of communication overhead and management complexity also grow. SCM is a critical tool to alleviate the organizational strain of growing development costs.

In this class you'll use Git to track changes for each of your exercises and projects. In order to use Git you'll need a Git client installed on your computer. A few good ones are:
  * [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (free)
  * [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) (not free)

GitHub is the most popular service for hosting collections of code stored in Cit (these collections are called "repositories"), and is where we'll be storing our code.
