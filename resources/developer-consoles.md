# Browser-based JavaScript Developer Consoles

Most modern browsers have a feature that's indespensible to front-end development called a "developer console".
* In this class we'll mostly use the **Console**, **Elements** (or **Inspector**), **Sources** (or **Debugger**), and maybe **Network** tabs.
* Nothing you do in the console is permanent -- so do anything you want! After you reload the page it will be as if you hadn't done anything at all.
