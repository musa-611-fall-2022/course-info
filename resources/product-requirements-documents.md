# Product Requirements Documents (PRD)

A product requirements document (PRD) is a document that describes the purpose, features, functionality, and behavior of the product youâ€™re about to build.

Start with "who". "What" is too commonly used as the starting place. That's the worst -- a solution in search of a problem. Should be:

  1.  **"Who"** -- describe the target user or users of your system. They should be at the granularity of fairly specific roles (e.g., "the school district" is not a role, but "teachers" or "superintindents" are roles; likewise "school district employees" _may_ be too general)
  1.  **"Why"** -- describe the problem(s) or goal(s) of the users above. For complex goals, it may be useful to understand the "user journey" for each goal as well. The specific needs at each point in those journies may be different. This may result in a "journey map" (a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal).
  1.  Finally, **"what"** -- describe a proposed solution to the users' needs. This may take the form of user stories, wireframes, ...

All of these descriptions may go into a product requirements document. Generally, your PRD should have these sections:

1.  **Purpose** -- This is primarily the who and why as defined above.
2.  **Features** -- the what from above. This should help you determine what done is. Your features should be intimately connected to your purpose: If you have a feature without a goal, is it really a necessary feature? If you have a goal without a feature, how can you expect your product to be successful?
3.  **Milestones** -- broadly, what are the things that need to be done for the project. Break these down into tasks as appropriate.
